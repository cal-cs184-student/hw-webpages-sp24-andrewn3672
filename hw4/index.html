            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In this assignment, we implemented physical simulation on a piece of cloth. In the first part of the project, we implemented generating the masses and springs. This was done by generating vectors that represented the masses and springs. In particular, the vector for the masses were in row major order. The main things we had to focus on when generating the grid for the masses was checking if the cloth was horizontal or vertical, and also marking the point masses that needed to be pinned. For the springs, we just had to go through our point mass grid and create the three different types of springs if they were in bounds. We did this by creating a helper function and simply passing in the dx and dy of the grid along with the spring type to easily construct our grid of springs. Now that our grids have been created, we want to actually be able to have basic simulation on the cloth. Part 2 of the project focuses on using numerical integration to simulate the movement of the cloth. We first calculate the total forces on the cloth, which include external forces such as gravity, and the spring forces themself. Once we have the calculated force for each point, we used Verlet integration to compute the point masses new position at the next time stamp. We also want to constrain the movement of the cloth, so that the springs do not become unreasonably deformed during each time step, so we make it such that between two point masses, the spring’s length is at most 10% greater than its rest_length. This allows the cloth to only fall down essentially, but it would fall infinitely if it was not pinned so we implement colliding with two other object types in part 3. The first thing we implemented colliding with is spheres. This is done simply by checking if the position of a point mass is inside the sphere, and bumping it out to the surface if it is. Similarly, for planes, we checked if the last position and current position were on opposite sides of the plane, and bump the position above the plane. The next issue we see is that if we simulate dropping the cloth vertically onto a plane, it should fold ontop of itself. This doesn’t happen yet since we haven’t implemented self collisions which is exactly what we do in part 4. The first thing of this part was to constrain what points we compare with one another as having a quadratic runtime of checking each point with every other point is too long. We first defined a hash function based on the point masses position and created a spatial map to let us know which points were close to each other. This makes it so each point mass is put into a bucket instead allowing only those in the same bucket to be compared. We then checked if point in a bucket with every other bucket, and calculated a correction for each other point within a certain range. Lastly, we implemented shaders which gives our cloth different and more realistic looks. The first type we implemented is diffuse which ties directly into blinn phong. This gives us realistic lighting on the cloth and sphere from a light source. Next was texture shading which allowed us to map our own texture onto the cloth and sphere. After were bump and displacement shaders. Bump mapping makes the cloth and sphere have the illusion of detail such as bumps and ridges. Displacement is very similar, except it actually affects the position of the vertices giving it a much more realistic shading compared to bump. Finally, we implemented environment-mapped reflections, which give the cloth and sphere a mirror shading. While implementing the project, our main issues came with messing up syntax in part 5. We combated this by running the code and adding each line we wrote in one at a time to figure out which line had an issue. Overall, we did not run into many issues and had a relatively calm time implementing each part.

            <h2>Part 1: Masses and Springs</h2>
            <p>
                In this part of the project, we constructed a grid of masses and springs. We first determined the dx and dy so that when we iterate over the points for height and width, we evenly spread out the position of each mass pointer properly. If the orientation of the cloth is horizontal, we make the y value of the point masses 1 for all of them. We then make the x position of a given point mass j * dx and the z i * dy. Otherwise, we get a random offset from -1/1000-1/1000 and set the z of the point mass to this. The x stays the same and y is set to i * dy. In both cases, we just emplace_back the current point to the back so it is in row major order. We then iterate over the pinned vector and set the point mass at the given positions to true. For the creation of the springs, we created a helper to check if a given x and y and its added dx and dy values are in bounds of the grid. If not, we do nothing, otherwise we create the spring and add it to our vector. The arguments of the helper are x, y, dx, dy, and spring type. This makes it very easy to iterate over all the points for height and width and just call our helper at the given point with the correct arguments to construct the springs. With this, we have created our grid.

            <h2>Part 2: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>
            <p>
                In this part of the project, we began implementing the physics of the cloth interacting with external forces and the spring forces. To calculate the total forces, we simply iterated over all of the external force accelerations and multiplied it by mass, and added this value to a total to get the total external forces. We then set the forces vector of the point mass to equal this total external force. To calculate the spring forces, we simply iterated over the springs and calculated Fs = Ks * (||pa - pb|| - l). We also multiplied the force by 0.2 if it was a bending spring since bending springs should be weaker than structural or shearing. We then multiply the Fs by d.unit() where d = pa - pb, and add it to the a and b mass particle forces making sure to make the a be negative instead to make sure the force of the two points are opposite of each other. For the Verlet integration, we iterated over all of the point masses, and calculated the the xt, vt, and at. Xt is just the position, vt = position - last position, and at is the forces divided by mass. We then apply the formula to update our position, and also make sure to save our previous position in the last_position variable. The new position ends up being xt + (1 - (damping / 100)) * vt + at * delta_t^2. Finally, we want to constrain the position updates to be at most 10% greater than its rest_length at the end of any time step. We did this by iterating over the springs, and first finding the distance between the two point masses of the spring. We then calculated the shift which is the min of 1.1 * rest_length and the norm of the distance, subtracted by the norm of the distance. If both point masses are pinned, we update both points to be half of the shift times the unit of the distance. Otherwise, if one is pinned, we just update the unpinned one to fully have the shift multiplied by the distance unit and the other stays the same.

                Changing the ks value causes the cloth to be much more rigid or droopy. With a really low ks value, the cloth droops down really low and doesn’t flow much when it is dropping. When looking at the final resting state, you can clearly see how much lower it hangs from the two pinned points. With the very high ks value of 100000, it’s almost like a rigid piece of paper just slowly flowing down with near to no creases forming. In the default 5000 ks value, you can clearly see more creases within the cloth and it is wavy when it is falling down. For a low ks value of 100, it definitely has the lowest point as it sags down the most. When it is falling, it seems like it is falling a bit faster and has less flow than 5000. To generalize, the higher the ks value, the more rigid the cloth is. This makes sense since having larger ks values makes the cloth more “springy” making it more rigid.

                When changing the values for density, a lower density led to a much stiffer cloth, and higher density lead to droopy cloth. When the cloth goes from start to rest with a density value of 1, there is very little creases or wave effects on the cloth as it falls. At the default density of 15, there is more ripples within the cloth as it falls and noticeable creases. Finally for a higher density of 100, more creases form as the cloth is falling and the creases are noticeably deeper compared to the other values. The lower the density, the stiffer the cloth is. This is because with less dense materials, it makes it lighter so it doesn’t droop down as much.

                When changing the values of damping, it changes how much forces affect the cloth. Because damping directly ties to the lost of energy, having 0% damping makes it so the cloth never reaches a resting state and the energy of the forces makes it so the cloth is always swaying and having the ripple effect on the cloth. When you first start the simulation at 0%, the cloth also aggressively swings up down super high and moves quite fast. On the opposite side, having 100% damping causes the cloth to get to rest super slowly, and the cloth doesn’t ripple as it’s approaching the resting state. At the standard of 20%, it has a combination of both described where it falls and ripples as it falls, and isn’t super slow, but also not super fast. Because damping doesn’t relate to the actual physical properties of the cloth, the final resting state will eventually be the same if the damping is not 0%.

            <h2>Part 3: Handling Collisions With Other Objects</h2>
            <p>
                For this part of the project, we implemented collisions with other objects so that when the cloth falls, it doesn’t just phase through other objects. In particular, we implemented collisions with spheres and planes. For the sphere, what we do is check if the position of the point mass is inside the sphere, then bump it out to the surface of the sphere. To achieve this, we first calculate the direction of the position with respect to the origin of the sphere. We are inside the sphere if the norm of the direction is less than or equal to the radius of the sphere. We then find the intersection tangent point which we want to move the position of the point mass by adding the origin and the radius * direction.unit(). We then want to calculate the correction to add to the last_position by taking this intersection and subtracting by the last_position. Finally, we update the position by adding last_position with the correction * (1 - friction). For the plane, we do something similar to the sphere. We first calculate where the point mass intersects the plane by using the same equation used in ray tracing. We first find the t with dot(point - pm.position, normal) / dot(normal, normal). We then find the exact intersection tangent with pm.position + t * normal. To check if the point mass has actually crossed the plane, we check dot(normal, pm.last_position - point) * dot(normal, pm.position - point) <= 0 to let us know if we crossed the plane from the previous time step to now. We then correct the correction by subtracting the intersection with the last_position. We also add SURFACE_OFFSET * normal and add it to the correction so we are not exactly inside the plane but a small distance above it. We then update the position to be last_position + correction * (1 - friction).

                Similar to the previous part when varying the ks values, we can see that with higher ks values, the cloth is more rigid and has fewer creases as seen in ks 50000. The lower the ks value, the more the cloth droops as seen in ks 500. When looking at the default ks of 5000, we can see there is a balance between the high and low ks values presented. Because the higher ks value makes the cloth more rigid and has fewer creases, the lowest point of the cloth is also higher than the rest. On the opposite end, the lowest ks valued cloth droops the lowest. Logically, because we are changing how strong the springs are, the higher the ks, the more springy it is and the less it droops.

            <h2>Part 4: Handling Self-Collisions</h2>
            <p>
                In this part of the project, we added self-collisions to the cloth so that the cloth would fold on top of itself rather than clipping through itself. To do this, we began by building a spatial hash map so that we can compare point masses that are close to each other rather than checking a point mass with every other point mass as this is inefficient. We do this by simply defining a hash function to describe where the point mass is, then iterate through all the point masses and insert them into the spatial hash map. To check for self-collisions, we grab the vector of other points within the spatial hash-map using the current point masses hash values and checking if the candidate point mass is within range of our current point mass. We do this by taking the distance of the current position and the position of the candidate point, and checking if the norm is less than or equal to 2 * thickness. If it is, We compute the correction to be (2*thickness - distance.norm()) * distance.unit(). We add this to a total correction vector that includes all of the candidates that are within range. Once we iterate through all of the candidates, we divide the total by the number of candidates we had corrections with and divide by the simulation_steps. We then add this correction to our point mass's current position. When iterating through candidates, we also make sure we don’t try to calculate a correction with ourselves.

                When varying the density of the cloth, we can see the properties of how the cloth folds onto itself. When comparing the lower density to the default, we can see that it has fewer folds on itself, but the folds themselves are much larger. On the opposite end, the largest density has many more folds on itself, but the folds themselves are much smaller. The default cloth is the in-between of the two extremes where it has more folds than the density of 1, but less than the density of 100. The folds are also smaller than the density of 1 but larger than the density of 100. Logically, this makes a lot of sense since when you drop a piece of paper, it has a very small density and doesn’t fold onto itself at all and instead falls flat.

                At different levels of ks values, we also see how it changes the amount of folds created as the cloth falls, but also changes the size of the folds. When looking at smaller ks values, we can see that there are many more folds as it falls on itself, but the folds are smaller when comparing them to the default ks value. With larger ks values, we can see there are much fewer folds, but the folds themselves as they form are much larger when the cloth falls on itself. You can also describe them as being much more bendy and wavy in terms of how the folds look because of the stronger springs. To summarize, a larger ks value leads to fewer folds, but the folds are much larger. Inversely, the smaller ks value has many more folds, but the folds themselves are much smaller.

            <h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
            <p>
                Shader programs operate on the geometry and color of objects during rendering. In this project we worked with vertex and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders operate on each vertex of the primitives in the scene. They set the final, screen-space location of each vertex in the scene being rendered. These screen-space locations are what the GPU triangle rasterizer uses when rasterizing all the primitives onto screen-space. The rasterizer generates fragments, which each can be thought of as a collection of samples and their corresponding data used to calculate the final color value for a particular pixel. The number of fragments created depends on the screen resolution, since one fragment is created for each pixel in the screen buffer. Each fragment collects values barycentrically-interpolated from the per-vertex operations done in the vertex shader. That is, the vertex shader assigns things like uv-texture coordinates, normal vectors, and new positions for each vertex; then the rasterizer generates a fragment for each pixel in the screen buffer and uses barycentric interpolation to collect interpolated uv-texture coordinates, normal vectors, and position for each fragment according to the triangle it lies within; these are the values that are passed into the fragment shader, which operates on each fragment individually.
