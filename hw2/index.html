            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In this assignment, we implemented algorithms and techniques to display meshes. In section 1 of the assignment, we implemented Bezier curves and surfaces utilizing De Casteljau’s subdivision algorithm. Task 1 allowed us draw curves using a specified number of control points, and we could see how the curve and point changed when we moved the control points around and messed around with the t value. Task 2 was an extension of task 1 where we moved from working with 2d Bezier curves to 3d Bezier surfaces. The high level idea of task 2 was identical to task 1 and this allwed us to generate more complex 3d objects such as a teapot. In section 2 of the assignment, we worked directly with the halfedge data structure to implement powerful functionality. In task 3, we traversed the surounding triangles that were connected to the vertex to find the normal of the vertex and allow for better shading for smooth surfaces. We implemented edge flipping in task 4 which becomes very useful for subdivision in task 6. This task can be very tricky if we do not carefully keep track of what pointers we are working with since the heart of the task was to rearrange the existing pointers to "flip" the edge in the mesh. Similarly in task 5, we implemented task splitting which is also important for subdivision. This task ends up being trickier than task 4 as not only do we need to keep track of existing pointers, we have to create new ones and assign everything to each other appropiately. In both task 4 and 5, we found it extremely important to draw otu diagrams for how we envisioned the pointer assignment would be, and name variables based off of our drawn diagrams to abstract all of the pointers. This allowed us to implement these operations with no bugs and allowed us to implement task 6 cleanly. Lastly, implementing task 6 allowed for us to upsample a given mesh and make it look much smoother than the original. This is because we are constantly subdividing the large triangles into smaller ones to allow us to define the features much more clearly. An important thing we learned from this task is that you may lose the original shape you had if the edges of the triangles are not symmetrical or in the way you want it to be. This is because subdivisioon utilizes splitting the original existing edges and flipping them, then moving the position of the vertices to round out the mesh. There is also a good stopping point when upsampling because after a certain level, you can hardly see a difference, and we are creating much more triangles which ends up destroying the performance of the programming. This can be clearly seen with each level of subdivision, the framerate of the program drops.

            <h2>Task 1</h2>
            <p>
                We evaluate the Bezier curves using de Casteljau’s algorithm, which is a series of recursive linear interpolations between many control points. We parameterize the Bezier curve using a parameter “t” that ranges from 0 to 1. When t = 0, the Bezier curve intersects with the first control point, and when t = 1, the Bezier curve intersects with the final control point. To get points for intermediate values of “t”, we first take the linear interpolations between the outer set of control points. If we have 4 control points, the next level in the algorithm will have 3 control points, which come from the three possible linear interpolations coming from pairs of consecutive control points. Then, using these 3 control points, we perform 2 linear interpolations between the two possible pairs of consecutive points along the three. This gives us two points, which we linearly interpolate once again to get the point along the Bezier curve. All of the linear interpolations use the same value “t” to interpolate. In terms of how we implemented our algorithm, we returned the points if the size of points was 1. Otherwise, we would initilize a new vector, then iterate through the points from i=0 to points.size() - 1. This lets us lerp points[i] and points[i+1] and append it to our vector. Once we finish looping through the pairs of points, we return our vector.

            <p>
                To get Bezier surfaces, we take a grid of orthogonally-oriented Bezier curves. We are given a (n x n) grid of 3D control points and we want to find a point on the surface parameterized by (u, v), where u and v both range between 0 and 1. We treat each row in this grid as the set of control points for a Bezier curve. For each row, we find the point on the Bezier curve parameterized by u. This leaves us with n points that are coplanar in a plane orthogonal to the u-direction. We treat these n points as the control points for the final Bezier curve. We find the point on this final Bezier curve parameterized by v. This final point is the corresponding point on the Bezier surface parameterized by (u, v). In our algorithm, we define evaluateStep() by taking in the vector of 3D points and doing one step of the De Casteljau subdivision. In evaluate1D(), we take the vector of points, and iteratively call evaluateStep() on the points until we are left with one. Finally, in evaluate(), we iterate through the rows and call evaluate1D() on each row with u being the input to t, appending the final value to a new vector. With this final vector of points, we call evaulate1D() one final time with v as the input to t, resulting in the final point desired on the bezier surface.

            <p>
                For an initial vertex v0, there can be an arbitrary amount of surrounding triangles. We start with v0’s halfedge. If we iterate through the halfedges using h = h->next(), we will traverse the sides of one of the triangles that surrounds v0. As we traverse the halfedges, we collect the two vertices that make up the triangle we are traversing. We call the first one we traverse v1 and the second one v2. The vectors (v1 - v0) and (v2 - v0) correspond to the two sides of the triangle that intersect with v0. These two vectors lie in the plane occupied by the triangle. If we take the cross product (v1 - v0) x (v2 - v0), we will get the vector that is normal to the plane of the triangle. The length of this vector is equal to the parallelogram that is spanned by (v1 - v0) and (v2 - v0). The area of the triangle is therefore ½ times the area of this parallelogram. We take the cross product in that order (i.e., (v1 - v0) x (v2 - v0) instead of (v2 - v0) x (v1 - v0)) because the halfedges are oriented such that the direction of the normal to the triangle they surround can be found with the right-hand rule. We go from triangle to triangle around v0 by taking h = h->next()->next()->twin(). For each triangle, we add (½ * (v1 - v0) x (v2 - v0)) to the running area-weighted sum of normals. After we return back to the original halfedge of the first triangle, we stop iterating, divide the area-weighted sum of normals by its norm, and return it. This returned vector is equivalently the area-weighted average of the normals of the surrounding triangles.

            <h2>Task 4</h2>
            <p>
                In our implementation of edge flip, we started by first defining all of the elements of the current existing triangles based on the chosen edge. We will call one triangle abc and the second triangle cbd. The half edges of abc are retrieved from taking the halfedge of e0 (the inputted edge) and calling it bc. We then iterate through the halfedgeiter to label ca then ab. We can then get vertices for abc by getting vertex a from ab, vertex b from bc, and vertex c from ca. Finally, we can get the face for abc from bc. For cbd, we do it in the same way, but we get the twin of bc to get cb. We then get the half edges for bd and dc. Vertex d is taken from dc. Lastly, we get the face for cbd from cb. We do not need to get the edges for anything other than the original one we are flipping because that will be the only edge we will be “moving”.
            </p>
            <img class="solo-image" src="task4explain.png">
            <p>
                The above image is how we will be flipping the triangle. We will translate abc to be dab, and cbd to adc. This means ca, ab, bd, and dc will be nearly the same other than updating it’s next pointer. We first look to update the halfedges for the new triangle. To do this, we translate cb to turn into da. We update da by da->setNeighbors(ab, cb, d, e0, abc). We know in the new triangle, da points to ab, and our twin will still be cb which later becomes “ad” but is still the same object. We set the vertex as d since that is where this halfedge will come out of. We will also treat abc as dab, but will also just be the same object. We then update ab to point to bd and bd to point to da. We also make sure their respective face corresponds to abc and everything else is the same. The second triangle we be translated in the same way. We can then reference cb as ad. To update ad we do essentially the same thing by ad->setNeighbors(dc, da, a, e0, cbd). This makes it so our next halfedge is dc, we essentially keep the same twin which is da (bc), keep the same edge, and treat our original triangle of cbd but can view it as adc. We then update dc and ca to have the correct next (ca and ad respectively) and face (cbd/adc). Next we want to make sure that all of the vertices are pointing to a correct half edge. In this case we made a point to ab, b point to bd, c point to ca, and d point to da. Similarly, we have to do the same for the faces. We set dab(abc) to da and cbd(adc) to ad. Finally we update the current edges halfedge to point to da to ensure it is correctly pointing to one of its half edges. The key thing to notice in our implementation is we wanted to make as minimal updates as possible. We found that the general direction of all the other edges (the one that wasn’t originally selected) were already correct and only need to have their next and face updated. This made it so we needed to modify less pointers and were less prone to bugs. This made implementation easier to visualize and no bugs were encountered.

            <h2>Task 5</h2>
            <p>
                For task 5, we begin by defining all of the relevant information needed from the original two triangles connected to the chosen edge. We will call the first triangle abc and the second triangle cbd. We will define everything in an identical fashion to task 4 where the half edges of abc will be bc, ca, and ab along with getting the edges a, b, and c from the respective half edges. Similarly in cbd, we get cb, bd, and dc and get vertex d which is not in the previous triangle. I will use the following diagram to explain how I went about implementing edge split.
            </p>
            <img class="solo-image" src="task5explain.png">
            <p>
                Before reassigning all of the pointers to form all of the new triangles, we will define all of the elements we need. From the diagram above, we can see we will be forming 2 new faces (triangles), 1 new vertex, and 3 new edges. 3 New edges means we will also need 6 new half edges (2 half edges per edge). We will first define a new vertex m, with newVertex(). We want the position of the new vertex to be the midpoint of the two vertices of the original edge which would be b and c in our case. We easily just add the positions of b and c, then divide by 2 to get the midpoint for the position of the new edge. We then define 3 new edges which we will call maEdge, mbEdge, and mdEdge (this will correspond to the visuals above). Additional the old cbEdge in the presplit will be reused and renamed as the mcEdge. We will define 2 new faces as abm and mbd (the two bottom triangles in the diagram). We will then rename abc to be mca, and cbd to be cmd. For the final new elements, we will define the half edges. The new halfedges we will define are am, ma, md, dm, bm, mb, mc, and cm. We will rename bc into mc and cb into cm. This corresponds to making the original edge into the top center edge. Now that we have defined everything to be in terms of what we see in the diagram, we just have to connect all the pieces together. We start off by connecting the half edges of each triangle starting with mca. We will assign the appropriate pointers for mc with mc->setNeighbors(ca, cm, m, mcEdge, mca). We make the next pointer ca and the twin cm. We come out of vertex m, have the edge as mcEdge and are part of the mca face. We do similar assignments for ca and am to form the half edges as seen in the diagram. For ca, we can see that we keep everything the same other than making sure the face corresponds to mca, and that the next pointer points to am. We follow this exact scheme for all of the half edges in cmd, abm, and mbd. Once we have properly assigned all of the pointers for the half edges according to what we see in the diagram, we want to make sure all the vertices are pointing to the correct half edge. We can make the vertex point to any one of it’s half edges and in our case, we decided to make a point to ab, b to bd, c to ca, d to dc, and m to mc. Similarly, we want to assign all of the new edges and faces to anyone of it’s corresponding half edges. In this case we choose maEdge to ma, mbEdge to mb, mcEdge to mc, and mdEdge to md. For the faces we set mca to ca, cmd to dc, abm to ab, and mbd to bd. Our strategy for our implementation was to clearly draw out how we visualized the triangles of the before and after. We are able to arbitrarily label everything since we still know all triangles will follow the same pattern. This allows us to easily visualize how we want to reassign all of our pointers to form the new triangles after the split. Additionally, we wanted to minimize the amount of pointers we had to reassign so similar to edge flip, we kept all of the outer edges practically identical only needing to change it’s next and face pointers. Carefully drawing and labeling all the components of our diagrams made implementation much simpler and less prone to errors since we knew exactly what we wanted to do. This led to no bugs and a correct implementation on the first try. The green arrows in the diagram represent the new half edges we have to create (and edges respectively) and the purple arrows represent reusing the original edge we selected to be part of the top two triangles. This allowed the twin of this edge to stay exactly the same. Because we clearly defined everything, we essentially just had to connect all the pieces together like a puzzle.

                The images above demonstrate what the wire mesh looks like when just spliting the edges and both splitting and flipping. We also show it with vertex normals.

            <p>
                First, we iterate through all of the original vertices in the mesh and compute its new 3D position according to its original position, its degree, and the sum of the surrounding vertex positions. We do not update each vertex’s position during the iteration because that would throw off the subsequent calculations we would do on its surrounding vertices. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, we iterate through all of the original edges inside the mesh. We will eventually end up splitting on all of these edges, so we precompute the 3D position of the vertex that will lie at the center of the edge by taking the weighted average of the vertices that make up the adjoining triangles. By this point, we will have precomputed the new 3D positions of all the old vertices in the mesh along with the 3D positions of the new vertices we have yet to add once we start splitting. These values are stored in convenient “edge->newPosition” (for the positions of to-be-added vertices) and “vertex->newPosition” (for the new positions of old vertices) struct members. In fact, the mesh still looks exactly the same as it originally did at this point: we have not flipped or split any edges, and all the vertices are still at their original 3D positions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The third step of the algorithm is the edge-splitting process. We start by iterating through all of the edges. For each edge, we get the two vertices it connects, v0 and v1. Then, before we do any splitting, we check if both the vertices are from the old mesh. If both are old vertices, we split the connecting edge. Otherwise, we don’t. This is because each time we split an edge, we actually create four “new” edges that we don’t want to split. Two of those edges will lie collinear with the original edge we just split, and two of those edges will be connected to the outermost vertices of the adjoining triangles of the original edge. The two collinear edges are guaranteed to connect an old vertex with the new vertex we just created at the center of the original edge. However, even though technically they are “new” edges, we want to consider them as “old” edges for the following reason: when we go to flip edges, we want to flip newly created edges that join an old vertex with a new vertex; however, we do not want to flip any of the collinear edges we created (these collinear edges make up the black edges on the diagram in the project specification). If we mark the collinear edges as “new”, then they would actually fit the criteria for flipping them later, which we do not want. As such, each time we split on an edge, we actually only mark the other two new edges as “new” (not the collinear ones). However, even though we don’t mark the collinear created edges as “new”, we don’t want to split on them again as we iterate through all the edges. This needs to be carefully handled because we are iterating through the list of edges but also adding new edges to that list in each iteration of the loop. In order to make sure we skip over all four of the edges we just created in a particular split, we only split on an edge if it connects two old vertices. Since all four of the edges we create in split are guaranteed to be connected to a new vertex (i.e., the vertex at the center of the split), this ensures that we do not split on any of those four newly created edges again, even if we only mark two of them as being “new”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fourth step of the algorithm is to flip the newly created edges that connect a new vertex with an old vertex. Again, each time we split in the previous step of the algorithm we technically made four new edges. However, we only want to consider edges that do not coincide with an edge originally in the mesh. Because we did not mark any of these collinear new edges as actually being new, we can safely flip edges that meet the following conditions: the edge connects an old vertex to a new one and it has been marked as new. As we iterate through the edges in the mesh we mark it as old irrespective of whether we ended up flipping it or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once we have completed the previous four steps, the mesh should be topologically the same as the final subdivided mesh we want. All we need to do is iterate through each vertex (old and new) and replace its 3D position with the new positions we precomputed in the first step of the algorithm. Then we are done.
            </p>

                When performing loop subdivision on the cube, the cube becomes increasingly asymmetric. It begins to look like a lopsided basketball. A key thing to notice though is that the more we subdivide, the object becomes smoother and smoother. After a certain number of subdivisions, you can barely tell a difference from when you toggle vertex normals. For the cube, as we subdivide, the edges and corners of the cube become rounded out, but not in a symmetrical way. This leads the original cube shape to be unidentifiable. We can reduce this effect and still maintain a cube-like structure by splitting all of the diagonal edges on each face. This makes it so that when we subdivide, it guarantees that every face will have a symmetrical pattern. For other meshes such as the teapot, we noticed that we did not need to do any preprocessing for the mesh to stay the same shape. The teapot became a lot smoother with subdivision and maintained its original shape very well.

            As we subdivide the cube with no pre-splitting, you can see we lose the cube shape with each level. Additionally, past level 4, the general shape of the mesh is solidified and doesn't really change. At level 6, you can no longer even see the triangles without the wire frame. This is because the triangles become so small that it just looks smooth to the human eye at this point. In the next set of images, we will presplit all of the diagoonal edges found on each face to achieve a more symmetrical look, and still have somewhat similar structure to the original cube.

            At level 0, you can see how the splitting differs from the original cube. From the visual intuition, you can already see the symmetry on each face of the cube so when we subdivde, it makes sense that it would maintain a much more symmetrical shape than without the pre-splitting. In the original, just looking at the face of the cube, we can see that if we split one face vertically down the middle, we would not be left with two symmetrical pieces. By symmetrical, I mean it does not reflect over the y-axis. Even the single diagonals of each face or not consistent with each other, so not matter what angle we look at, the original cube will always look asymmetrical. When looking at the presplit levels, we can still see a cube structure, similar to that of a rounded dice.

            When looking at the face view of the presplit cube and the original cube, both at level 6, we can still clearly see a symmetrical square shape on the presplit cube. The original is very asymetrical and the cube shape can barely be recognized. In the original cube, because we only split the orignal edges once, all of the faces having different non symmetrical diagonals makes it so that the splits and subsequences splits will not be identical to each other. In the presplit faces, you can see how the triangles from the wire frame get smaller at the centers of each face showing where the symmetrical nature of the subdivision is coming from. Although we cannot perfectly prevent the edges from being rounded out, pre-splitting definitely allows us to maintain the original shape of the cube.
